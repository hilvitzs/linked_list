#Linked-List

Our project was to create a bookmark saver. We are supposed to be able to enter a website title and website url and that information will fill out a bookmark card that will populate on the screen.

Within the bookmark button there should be a read button that changes the styling elements when it is clicked.

There should also be a delete button that clears the bookmark and card from the page.

We have also added a counter that lets the user know how many bookmarks they have, how many are marked as read, and how many are not marked as read.

It was also necessary to make the page responsive. Towards this end we have added media queries to change font-size, etc. to make sure that the page looks good on small screen sizes.`
